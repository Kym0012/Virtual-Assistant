## Virtual Assistant
The Virtual Assistant is a Python program that listens for user commands through a microphone, recognizes the commands using speech recognition, performs a Wikipedia search based on the recognized command, and reads out the summary using text-to-speech.

## Features
Speech Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize speech input from the user.
Natural Language Understanding: Interprets user commands and performs actions based on the recognized text.
Wikipedia Integration: Retrieves relevant information from Wikipedia based on the user's command.
Text-to-Speech: Utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text into spoken audio for user feedback.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
speech_recognition library (install via pip install SpeechRecognition)
pyttsx3 library (install via pip install pyttsx3)
Internet connection for speech recognition and Wikipedia search.
##Usage
Install the required libraries using pip:

## Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
Run the virassistant.py script:

## Copy code
python virassistant.py
Clear background noises by following the on-screen instructions.

Speak a command into the microphone.

The assistant will recognize the command, search Wikipedia for relevant information, and read out the summary.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with speech recognition, ensure that your internet connection is stable and that firewall/antivirus settings are not blocking the connection to the Google Speech Recognition service.
If the assistant fails to retrieve information from Wikipedia or encounters errors, check your internet connection and verify that the Wikipedia service is operational.
